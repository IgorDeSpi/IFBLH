First screen Explanations
===

1. On the left side, you will have access to the user's personal informations, in the form of a list. You will have access to details such as:

- Your own avatar
- Your name 
- Your location
- Your favourite places where you want to see the weather

2. If someone asks you to show the weather where you are, a yes and a no pad will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen. If you answer yes a camera icon will appear in the bottom right corner to share a picture of the sky from where you are.

3. A search bar will be available at the top of the screen to allow you to find the weather at a specific location you want. A heart-shaped icon will allow you to add a location to your favourites.  

4. You can also choose a location from the map. You will then just have to ping the location whose weather you want to know. The map will be on the right side of the screen.
